# Magic Tiles 3 Code Structure System

This document outlines a potential code structure for Magic Tiles 3, based on the analysis of its gameplay mechanics. The structure focuses on modularity, maintainability, and scalability, common practices in game development, especially when using Unity.

## I. Code Struct System

The code is organized into several main modules:

*   **Audio:** Handles music playback and synchronization.
*   **Beatmap:** Manages the loading, parsing, and processing of beatmap data.
*   **Tile:** Controls the creation, movement, and destruction of tiles.
*   **Input:** Handles player input and tap detection.
*   **Feedback:** Provides visual and auditory feedback to the player.
*   **Gameplay:** Manages the overall game state, scoring, and progression.
*   **UI:** Controls the user interface elements.
*   **Networking** (Optional): Manages the multiplayer features if available.
*   **Data Management**: Manages song lists, user data, and other persistent data.

## IV. Detailed Explanations and Considerations

*   **Modularity:** Each script is responsible for a specific aspect of the game, making the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain.
*   **Associations:**  The "Associations" column in the table above indicates which scripts communicate with each other. This helps visualize the dependencies between different parts of the code.
*   **Data Structures:** The `BeatmapManager` will likely use custom data structures (e.g., a `Beat` class or struct) to represent the timing and properties of each tile.
*   **Object Pooling:** The `TileManager` could benefit from object pooling to improve performance by reusing tile objects instead of constantly creating and destroying them.
*   **Design Patterns:** Consider using design patterns like the Singleton pattern for managers (`AudioManager`, `GameplayManager`) and the Observer pattern for event handling (e.g., when a tile is tapped).
*   **Comments:** Thoroughly comment your code to explain the purpose of each script and method.

This structure is a starting point and can be adapted based on the specific needs of the game. Remember to prioritize clear, concise, and well-organized code for a more efficient and enjoyable development process.
